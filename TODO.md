## Voice 

- [X] Device selection

## QA

- [ ] *Maybe:* Typing indicators
- [ ] 🪲 *Bug:* Leaving MpEx settings flow coordinator will break the chat title button (activation event never triggers for the lobby setup view?)
- [ ] *Less important*: Chat view will lag if *left open only* with lots of messages piling up; older game objects might need to be removed (cap to messages buffer size).
